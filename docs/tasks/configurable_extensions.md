# Configurable File Extensions

Status: Implemented

This task introduced configurable file extensions for the GenAIcode tool. It added a new configuration option in `.genaicoderc` called "extensions", allowing users to specify which file types the tool should recognize and process. This feature enhances the tool's flexibility by enabling support for various programming languages and file types beyond the initially hardcoded list.
