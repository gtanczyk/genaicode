# Context Shrinking Feature

Status: Implemented

This task implemented a context shrinking feature in the GenAIcode tool. It introduced a token-aware nudge mechanism in the step-ask-question flow, automatically suggesting and applying context reductions when necessary. This feature helps manage the token count of conversations, optimizing performance and avoiding token limits by intelligently reducing the context while maintaining essential information for code generation tasks.
