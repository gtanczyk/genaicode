# New Configuration Options

Status: Implemented

This task added new configuration options to the .genaicoderc file in the GenAIcode tool. It introduced the concept of "important context," allowing users to specify additional context (text prompts or file contents) that should always be included in code generation requests. This feature enhances the tool's ability to generate more relevant and context-aware code by ensuring critical information is never excluded by content masks or ignore patterns.
