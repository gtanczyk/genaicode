# Context Compression Feature Implementation

## Overview

The context compression feature aims to manage large prompt histories by allowing users to manually trigger a compression of the conversation history. This feature will help prevent issues related to exceeding token limits, increased latency, and higher costs while maintaining the quality of AI interactions.

## Problem Statement

As conversations grow longer, the prompt history can become too large (>200k tokens), leading to:

- Token limit exceeded errors
- Increased latency in responses
- Higher costs due to processing large amounts of tokens
- Reduced model performance
- Memory limitations
- Inconsistent behavior

## Implementation Details

### 1. Context Compression Step

#### New Step Implementation

- Location: `src/prompt/steps/step-context-compression.ts`
- Purpose: Compress the prompt history into a more concise form while preserving essential information
- Input: Current prompt history array
- Output: Compressed prompt history array

#### Compression Process

1. Preserve Initial Items (unchanged):

   - Initial messages
   - Initial getSourceCode response
   - Initial user prompt

2. Compress Subsequent Items:
   - Summarize conversation messages into a single summary item
   - Collapse all source code context updates into one requestFilesContent item
   - Preserve the most recent messages (configurable number) to maintain immediate context

### 2. UI Changes

#### Context Size Display

- Add a token count display in the UI
- Show warning indicators when context size exceeds thresholds:
  - Warning level: >100k tokens
  - Critical level: >150k tokens

#### Compression Button

- Add a "Compress Context" button in the chat interface
- Location: Near the input area or in the toolbar
- Visual feedback during compression process
- Disable button when compression is not needed (context size below threshold)

#### Token Count Updates

- Real-time updates of token count after each interaction
- Visual indicator showing the reduction in tokens after compression

### 3. Backend Integration

#### Prompt Service Integration

- Modify `src/prompt/prompt-service.ts` to handle compression requests
- Add new endpoint for triggering context compression
- Ensure compression step is correctly integrated into the prompt processing pipeline

#### Context Management

- Implement efficient storage of compressed context
- Maintain cache of recent uncompressed history for potential recovery
- Handle edge cases where compression might fail

### 4. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests

- Test compression algorithm efficiency
- Verify preservation of essential context
- Check token count calculation accuracy
- Test edge cases and error handling

#### Integration Tests

- Verify UI updates reflect backend changes
- Test compression button functionality
- Validate warning system behavior

#### End-to-End Tests

- Test complete workflow with real conversations
- Verify code generation quality after compression
- Performance testing with large contexts

### 5. Technical Considerations

#### Token Calculation

- Use existing token estimation utilities
- Consider different model token limits
- Account for token usage in compressed summaries

#### Performance Optimization

- Implement caching for compressed contexts
- Optimize compression algorithm for large histories
- Consider async processing for large contexts

#### Error Handling

- Implement fallback mechanisms if compression fails
- Provide user feedback for failed compressions
- Allow manual recovery of uncompressed history

## Expected Outcomes

1. Reduced Context Size

   - Measurable reduction in token usage
   - Improved response times
   - Lower costs per interaction

2. Better User Experience

   - Clear visibility of context size
   - Control over context compression
   - Maintained conversation quality

3. Improved System Stability
   - Fewer token limit errors
   - More consistent model performance
   - Better resource utilization

## Future Enhancements

1. Automatic Compression

   - Implement automatic compression triggers based on token thresholds
   - Add user preferences for compression settings

2. Advanced Compression Options

   - Allow users to choose compression level
   - Provide different compression strategies
   - Add custom rules for context preservation

3. Analytics and Monitoring
   - Track compression effectiveness
   - Monitor token usage patterns
   - Gather metrics for optimization
