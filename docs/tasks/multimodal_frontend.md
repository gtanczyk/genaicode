# Multimodal Functionality Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding multimodal functionality to the GenAIcode project. The goal is to enable users to upload images during the initial execution of codegen, which can then be used in the context of AI-assisted code generation. This feature will support three methods of image upload: standard file picker, drag and drop, and paste.

## 2. Frontend Implementation

### 2.1 File Picker

- Update `/Users/gtanczyk/src/codegen/src/main/ui/frontend/app/components/input-area.tsx`:
  - Add a file input element for image selection
  - Implement onChange handler to process selected files

### 2.2 Drag and Drop

- Modify `/Users/gtanczyk/src/codegen/src/main/ui/frontend/app/components/input-area.tsx`:
  - Add drag and drop event listeners (dragover, dragleave, drop)
  - Implement drop handler to process dragged files

### 2.3 Paste Functionality

- Update `/Users/gtanczyk/src/codegen/src/main/ui/frontend/app/components/input-area.tsx`:
  - Add onPaste event listener to the component
  - Implement paste handler to process pasted image data

### 2.4 Image Preview and Management

- Create a new component `/Users/gtanczyk/src/codegen/src/main/ui/frontend/app/components/image-preview.tsx`:
  - Display thumbnails of uploaded images
  - Provide option to remove individual images

### 2.5 Client-side Validation

- Implement in `/Users/gtanczyk/src/codegen/src/main/ui/frontend/app/components/input-area.tsx`:
  - Check file type (allow only image files)
  - Validate file size (max 5MB per image)
  - Limit the number of images (e.g., max 10 images)

## 3. Backend Changes

### 3.1 Update CodegenOptions

- Modify `/Users/gtanczyk/src/codegen/src/main/codegen-types.ts`:
  - Add a new property to the CodegenOptions interface:
    ```typescript
    uploadedImages?: {
      id: string;
      data: Buffer;
      mimeType: string;
    }[];
    ```

### 3.2 Image Handling

- Update `/Users/gtanczyk/src/codegen/src/main/ui/backend/service.ts`:
  - Implement function to generate unique IDs for uploaded images
  - Add method to store uploaded images in memory
  - Implement server-side validation for file size and type

### 3.3 Update getImageAssets

- Modify `/Users/gtanczyk/src/codegen/src/files/read-files.ts`:
  - Update getImageAssets function to include in-memory uploaded images
  - Generate temporary URLs for in-memory images

### 3.4 Modify contextImageAssets

- Update `/Users/gtanczyk/src/codegen/src/prompt/prompt-service.ts`:
  - Adjust contextImageAssets handling to work with new image references

## 4. API Modifications

### 4.1 Update Execute Codegen Endpoint

- Modify `/Users/gtanczyk/src/codegen/src/main/ui/backend/api.ts`:
  - Update the `/execute-codegen` endpoint to accept multipart form data
  - Process uploaded images and add them to CodegenOptions

## 5. Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Frontend Basic Implementation

1. Implement file picker functionality
2. Add drag and drop support
3. Implement paste functionality
4. Create image preview component

### Stage 2: Frontend Enhancements

1. Implement client-side validation
2. Improve UI/UX for image upload and preview

### Stage 3: Backend Changes

1. Update CodegenOptions interface
2. Implement server-side image handling and validation
3. Modify getImageAssets to include uploaded images

### Stage 4: API and Integration

1. Update execute-codegen API endpoint
2. Integrate frontend with new API
3. Modify contextImageAssets handling

### Stage 5: Testing and Refinement

1. Implement unit tests for new functionality
2. Perform integration testing
3. Refine based on test results and feedback

## 6. Potential Risks and Considerations

1. **Performance Impact**: Handling large images or multiple uploads simultaneously may affect application performance. Consider implementing a queue system for processing uploads.

2. **Memory Management**: Storing images in memory could lead to high memory usage. Implement proper cleanup mechanisms and consider setting an upper limit on total memory usage for uploaded images.

3. **Security Concerns**: Ensure proper sanitization and validation of uploaded files to prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS attacks or malicious file uploads.

4. **Browser Compatibility**: Some advanced features like paste functionality might not work consistently across all browsers. Implement fallback mechanisms and thorough cross-browser testing.

5. **Scalability**: As the number of users and uploads increases, the current in-memory storage might not be sufficient. Consider implementing a more scalable solution in the future, such as temporary file storage or integration with a cloud storage service.

6. **User Experience**: Ensure clear feedback to users about upload progress, success, and any errors. Implement proper error handling and user-friendly error messages.

7. **API Changes**: The modification of the execute-codegen endpoint to handle multipart form data might affect existing integrations. Ensure backward compatibility or provide clear migration guidelines.

8. **Testing Complexity**: Multimodal functionality adds complexity to testing scenarios. Develop a comprehensive test suite covering various upload methods and edge cases.

9. **Future Extensibility**: Consider designing the implementation in a way that allows for easy addition of new upload methods or integration with different storage solutions in the future.

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to adding multimodal functionality to the GenAIcode project. By following these stages and addressing the potential risks, we can ensure a robust and user-friendly implementation of image upload and processing capabilities.
