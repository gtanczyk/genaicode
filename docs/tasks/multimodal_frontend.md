# Multimodal Frontend Implementation

Status: Implemented

This task added multimodal functionality to the GenAIcode web UI. It allows users to include images along with their text prompts for enhanced code generation. The implementation enables image uploads, displays uploaded images in the chat interface, and integrates image data into the AI service requests, providing a more comprehensive context for code generation tasks.
