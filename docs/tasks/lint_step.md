# Lint Step Refactor

Status: Implemented

This task involved refactoring the usage of the lint command in the GenAIcode tool. The implementation improved the handling of lint checks before and after code generation, addressing the issue of missing context in post-codegen lint checks. This enhancement ensures more accurate and context-aware linting, improving the overall code quality produced by the tool.
