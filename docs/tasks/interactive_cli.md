# Interactive CLI Mode

Status: Implemented

This task added an interactive CLI mode to the GenAIcode tool. It introduced a new `--interactive` option that transforms how the app works, prompting the user for inputs that would typically be provided as CLI options in non-interactive mode. This feature enhances user experience by guiding users through the code generation process, allowing them to configure options and execute tasks interactively.
