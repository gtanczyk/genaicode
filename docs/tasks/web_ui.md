# Web Interface for GenAIcode

Status: Implemented

This task involved creating a web-based user interface for the GenAIcode tool. The implementation provides a graphical interface for interacting with the code generation process, making it more accessible to users who prefer a visual interface over the command-line tool. The web UI includes features such as interactive code editing, real-time updates, and integration with existing GenAIcode functionality, all while maintaining security through localhost-only access and secure handling of AI service credentials.
