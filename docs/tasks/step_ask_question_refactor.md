the current state of the `executeStepAskQuestion` function and my ideas for improving it. Here are some key observations and potential areas for improvement:

1. Function Length: The function is quite long (over 200 lines), which can make it difficult to understand and maintain.

2. Complexity: It handles multiple responsibilities, including asking questions, handling different action types, and managing permissions.

3. Nested Conditionals: There are several levels of nested if-else statements, which can reduce readability.

4. Repetitive Code: Some code patterns are repeated, especially when handling different action types.

5. Error Handling: There's limited explicit error handling, which could be improved.

To address these issues, I'm considering the following refactoring strategies:

1. Extract Methods: Break down the function into smaller, more focused functions for each major responsibility.

2. Use a State Machine or Command Pattern: To handle different action types more cleanly.

3. Improve Error Handling: Add try-catch blocks and more robust error reporting.

4. Reduce Nesting: Flatten some of the nested conditionals using early returns or switch statements.

5. Enhance Type Safety: Use more specific types or type guards to reduce the need for type assertions.
