# Step Ask Question Refactor

Status: Implemented

This task involved refactoring the `executeStepAskQuestion` function in the GenAIcode tool. The implementation aimed to improve the function's structure, readability, and maintainability by addressing issues such as excessive length, complexity, and nested conditionals. The refactoring enhanced error handling and type safety, resulting in a more robust and efficient question-asking step in the code generation process.
