# Project Structure Refactor

Status: Implemented

This task involved a comprehensive refactoring of the GenAIcode project structure. The implementation reorganized the codebase into a more logical and maintainable structure, separating concerns into distinct directories such as cli, files, prompt, and ai-service. This refactoring improved the overall organization of the project, making it easier for developers to navigate and maintain the codebase.
