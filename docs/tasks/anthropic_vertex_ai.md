# Claude via Vertex AI

Status: Implemented

This task added support for using the Anthropic Claude model via Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform in the GenAIcode tool. It introduced a new option `--vertex-ai-claude` which enables the use of Claude through Vertex AI instead of other AI models, providing users with an additional powerful language model option for code generation tasks.
